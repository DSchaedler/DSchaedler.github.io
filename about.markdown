You may be looking for the [Unofficial DragonRuby Wiki](https://ejectdrive.com/Ruby_for_Dragons/).

My name is Dee.

I'm a nerd, and this is my website. I've had several before, but this one is the one I have now. I usually start making things, and then abandon them. I will probably abandon this site.

This isn't a resume, or a journal. It isn't a for-profit blog. It's just a site where I write things. I hope that you like my thoughts.
