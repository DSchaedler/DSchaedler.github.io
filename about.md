My name is Dee.

I'm a nerd, and this is my website. I've had several before, but this one is the one I have now. I usually start making things, and then abandon them. I will probably abandon this site.

This isn't a resume, or a journal. It isn't a for-profit blog. It's just a site where I write things. I hope that you like my thoughts.

The most thorough self-introduction I've written is on [Hive](https://hive.blog/introduction/@queenmeteor/an-introduction-to-queenmeteor-and).

The source for this page can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DSchaedler/DSchaedler.github.io).
