I DM on occasion, and I always hate planning. It's hard to have compelling adventure hooks, it's hard to have interesting and balanced foes, and it's hard to improvise on the fly. Even running pre-written modules requires so much planning, studying, and materials preparation. If you ever play D&D, thank your DM.

So what can we do to make D&D prep easier?

Forget about the numbers.

Forget about XP, forget about challenge rating, forget about loot tables. Forget about stocking shops, forget about having names of places prepared. Forget about having NPC backstories.

Take in mind with all of this advice to always favor the players.

**House Rules:**  
- Healh potions heal a random amount as a bonus action, and their maximum amount as an action.
- Ties favor the player.
- Critical fails ( Natural 1 ) deal 1d4 damage to the roller.

**Player Responsibilities:**  
- Knowing and understanding their character sheet and abilities.
- Tracking spell slots, materials, concentration.
- Tracking ammunition.
- Notifying DM about status effects, low health, resistances, immunities, etc.
- Finding answers to technical questions in source books. Rulings at DM discretion.
- Having a plan.

**Enemies and Encounters:**  
D&D is designed for 6-8 Medium to Hard encounters per day, approxamately 18 rounds of combat. If you like to have players long rest at the end of each session, make your encounters harder.

Challenge Rating is a lie. What's more important is action and damage economy. I ran a campaign for a single player against a group of bandits. Based on their CR, it should have been easy, but the player was decimated.

- Keep the total number of enemies low, prefferably less than 3-4. If you need more enemies, make them 1 hit kills, with a 10% chance of surviving an attack. Track how many are left, not individual creatures.
- Make sure the number of actions per round is balanced between enemies and players. Make sure the damage per attack is balanced. By balanced, I mean almost equal. 
- Give big enemies a cool ability they can use that recharges if they roll a 5 or 6. 
- Make small enemies have an extra +1 to attack if they have an ally within 5 feet of a party member.
- Give a big enemy or commander a multiattack option that recharges on a 5 or 6.
- Give players an ally NPC for the encounter. The NPC will act on their own (DM controlled) but follow the suggestions or orders of the players. The NPC should fill a missing niche in the party as a healer, crowd control, damage sponge, etc. Avoid role-playing with yourself, make them useful but ultimately unimportant.

**Shops:**  
Adventuring is a well known profession in the D&D world. Most shops will carry basic adventuring supplies. Niche items will be available at weird shops in major cities.
