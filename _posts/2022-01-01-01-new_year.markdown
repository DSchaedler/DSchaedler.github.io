This year is going to be different.

We've all said that. But one month into hitting the Gym, something comes up, we take the weekend off, and never seem to make it back.

Something that I've been learning is how to acheive change through small steps. By "Learning" I mean that I heard that it helps.

This blog is a small step. Each post is a small step. They will be short, rambling, and often very non-technical. I hope that's okay for all of you out there.

Happy New Year. And remember; baby steps are still progress.
