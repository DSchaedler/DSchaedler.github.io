## What is Tails?
Tails is designed to help you use the Internet anonymously and get around censorship. It lets you connect to the Internet using virtually any computer while leaving no trace of your activities after you have finished. Tails connects to the hardware of a computer but doesn’t use the operating system or disk drives. That means there is no permanent record of your activities on that computer. Once you remove the Tails USB Stick or DVD and restart the computer, there will be no way to tell Tails was used there. Tails is far safer than the typical operating system, but it is not foolproof. [3]

### How good is this really?
Tails and the Tor project were developed by the US Government for secure espionage. They realized that if they only used it themselves, everyone would be able to tell who was government and who wasn't. In order to keep it secure for their own use, they were forced to release it publicly and keep it secure for everyone to use. The US Goverment is still the primary financial backer of Tails and the Tor project.

If you follow the instructions provided by Tails, people will know that someone is using it, but they won't be able to tell who.

### Advantages
- Use almost any computer, including those owned by other people. [1]
- Leave no trace on the computer when you are done. [1]
- Save important files, emails, and bookmarks to persistent storage on the Tails drive. [1]

### What disappears?
- Websites that you visited. [1]
- Passwords that you typed. [1]
- Networks and WiFi that you connected to. [1]

### Tails is safe, but not magic
- Files you share may still have date, time, location, and device information. [2]
- Using Tails for more than one purpose at a time may reveal your identity. [2]
- Tails cannot hide that you are using Tails and Tor from sites you connect to. [2]
- Tails may not hide your communications from skilled, determined attackers. [2]
- If you use a computer which is compromised, your security may be as well. [2]

## Using Tails
This document assumes that you have been provided with a copy of Tails on a USB Drive. It's best not to label the drive in any way. If you think someone could take it off you, destroy it.
