A lot of my personal philosiphy comes from Boy Scouts.

> ## The Scout Oath
>
> On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.

> ##The Scout Law
>
> A Scout is:
> TRUSTWORTHY. Tell the truth and keep promises. People can depend on you.  
> LOYAL. Show that you care about your family, friends, Scout leaders, school, and country.  
> HELPFUL. Volunteer to help others without expecting a reward.  
> FRIENDLY. Be a friend to everyone, even people who are very different from you.  
> COURTEOUS. Be polite to everyone and always use good manners.  
> KIND. Treat others as you want to be treated. Never harm or kill any living thing without good reason.  
> OBEDIENT. Follow the rules of your family, school, and pack. Obey the laws of your community and country.  
> CHEERFUL. Look for the bright side of life. Cheerfully do tasks that come your way. Try to help others be happy.  
> THRIFTY. Work to pay your own way. Try not to be wasteful. Use time, food, supplies, and natural resources wisely.  
> BRAVE. Face difficult situations even when you feel afraid. Do what you think is right despite what others might be doing or saying.  
> CLEAN. Keep your body and mind fit. Help keep your home and community clean.  
> REVERENT. Be reverent toward God. Be faithful in your religious duties. Respect the beliefs of others.
