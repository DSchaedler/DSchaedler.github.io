## What is ADHD?

> Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder... ADHD often carries over into adulthood.
>
> ADHD is a highly genetic, brain-based syndrome that has to do with the regulation of a particular set of brain functions and related behaviors.
>
> These brain operations are collectively referred to as “executive functioning skills” and include important functions such as attention, concentration, memory, motivation and effort, learning from mistakes, impulsivity, hyperactivity, organization, and social skills. There are various contributing factors that play a role in these challenges including chemical and structural differences in the brain as well as genetics.

## So what does this mean?

Well, unfortunately it means a lot of the things society expects adults to be able to do, I can't do, or do poorly.

Let's break down each of the sections above:

### Attention & Concentration

The namesake of ADHD, attention disregulation is a huge portion of the ADHD experience. 

This can manifest as symptoms like:

- Difficulty focusing
- Misplacing items
- Lack of listening

However, Concentration is the other side of the Attention coin. As much as I cannot focus in some instances, I can be hyperfocused on specific tasks, even to the point of neglecting my health and bodilty needs. I don't determine what I am concentrating on. If something isn't interesting enough for my brain, it gets no attention or concentration. The more interesting thing does.

### Memory & Learning from Mistakes

Because I have no control over my attention, I have no control over what I am focusing on or thinking about. This means if I'm not focusing on it, I won't remember it. It also means that if there isn't some stimulus to trigger a memory, I'm not going to remember that I have to do anything.

This can manifest as:
 
 - Misplacing Items
 - Always running late
 - Relationship troubles
 - Loss of Daily Routine
 - Risky behaviors

### Motivation & Effort

This is closely tied to the Attention & Concentration section (I'm saying this a lot, aren't I)? I am a highly motivated person. When I get interested in a topic, or person, or project I throw my entire self at it. I have learned so many things due to 3 AM deep dives into Wikipedia. But if I'm not interested in it, then it becomes almost impossible to motivate myself to do it. I won't put in more effort than is required to avoid consequences. If I forget to do it entirely (memory dysregulation) then those consequences are inevitable.

This can manifest as:

 - Difficulty focusing
 - Inability to prioritize
 - Relationship troubles

### Impulsivity & Hyperactivity

So, knowing that I can't control my Attention, Concentration, Motivation, and Effort, does it start to make sense why ADHD kids are seen as Impulsive & Hyperactive? My brain is constantly filtering my life experience. Trying to find the most interesting, or most rewarding, or most engaging thing to do. Stick me in a room with 20 kids to do someting boring and tell me to sit still and be quiet, and see how you expect that to work. We are just looking for anything to do that is more interesting than what I am doing now. Give me a lava lamp to look at, or a quiet project to do, or let me read while you teach your lesson.

This can manifest as:

 - Difficulty focusing
 - Risky behaviors
 - Lack of listening
 - Inability to prioritize
 - Relationship troubles
 - Nervous energy

### Organization

Continuing to build this up, if I can't control my Attention, Motivation, and Impulsivity, then why would I ever organize? That's a boring task with minimal reward and there are more valuable things I can be doing at any given time. Most of the time, I don't even realize the clutter because that's not where my attention is. And when I need to find something, I know where I like to use that thing, so I look there and usually find it. Cleaning means that stuff gets put away, which means it won't get any attention, which means that I will forget that it exists.

This can manifest as:

 - Misplacing items
 - Always running late
 - Inability to prioritize
 - Relationship troubles
 - Memory issues

### Social Skills

Finally, ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder. This means that the dysregulation I experience with my executive function also applies to my emotions and social skills. This is the part which seems the most disconnected, but can be the most important to understand. When I have an emotion, it gets all of my Attention, Motivation, Effort, and Impulsivity. That can be Joy, Anger, Depression, or any emotion. If I'm feeling something, I'm feeling it near 100%.

Additionally, my executive function difficulties means I don't learn or understand the normal social niceties that most people do. I don't know what is appropriate at all times. I don't have coping skills to deal with my executive dysfunction. I don't know how to process my emotions in a healthy way. These are things I need to learn.

This can manifest as:

 - Risky behaviors
 - Relationship troubles
 - Nervous energy
 - Easily angered

## So what does all of this mean?

Honestly, it means that ADHD people need a lot of coping skills to understand how to exist in a society that isn't built for us. We are not equipped to hande the expectations of neurotypical people, and when that leads to consequences, our strong sense of hurt, rejection, and justice mean that we can have extremely strong reactions.

But it also means that our brains have developed skills that others don't have.

Because we are constantly evaluating our world, we are very good at disregarding irrelevant facts and making snap decisions. When we find an activity that is engaging, we can become hyperfocused and spend way more time and effort before getting burnt out. 

ADHD is not a superpower. It is a disability, at least in our current society. But what it really is, is just a different way of thinking. It isn't bad, and doesn't need to be fixed. It needs to be accomodated. It does mean that some other personality and thought styles will be incompatible. And that's okay.
